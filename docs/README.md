# Introduction

This is a research and teaching code for the finite element method. It works in parallel on Windows, Mac and Linux. It uses minimal fancy programming like object-oriented programming and pointers to pointers to pointers, etc. The intent or goal of the software is to provide a well-designed, fast, parallel finite element code that engineers with minimal software skills can read it and follow along.
