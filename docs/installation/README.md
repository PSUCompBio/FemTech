# Installation

## Software required

Broadly we use Linux command line tools to build \(a.k.a compile\) the code. The code is designed to be "cross-platform" meaning it works on Windows, Mac and Linux. To do this we use Cmake.  Paraview is used to visualize the results. 

On Windows, it is possible to use a combination of Cmake and Visual Studio to build and work with the code. However, the current recommendation is to use Atom and Cygwin for the work flow. Modern Cygwin, with the correct packages installed, seems to be very similar to linux. 

See the corresponding pages for descriptions on how to build on each OS.
