# Windows - Cygwin Based Build \(Current\)

The current suggested setup to work on Windows is to use Atom for editing source code and Cygwin terminal for building \(a.k.a compiling\). 

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. Download and install Atom: [https://atom.io/](https://atom.io/)
2. Download and install Cygwin: [https://cygwin.com/](https://cygwin.com/) 
   1. Here you will need to use the installer to select a few different packages. I am able to provide a full list of the package I currently have - it is long and it is possible to go down the list one-by-one to check that you are installing it but, a good first step might be to install a few big ones I remember and then go from there. The big ones I remember are openmpi, cmake, gcc \(including gfortran\). Start with this.  Below is the full list \(text file\).  
3. Download and install Paraview: [https://www.paraview.org/](https://www.paraview.org/)
